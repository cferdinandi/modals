## Getting Started

Compiled and production-ready code can be found in the `dist` directory. The `src` directory contains development code.

### 1. Include Modals on your site.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/modals.css">
<script src="dist/js/modals.js"></script>
```

### 2. Add the markup to your HTML.

Add the `[data-modal]` attribute to your modal toggle. Add the `.modal` class and the `[data-modal-window]` to your modal window. Be sure to assign each modal a unique ID.

```html
<a data-modal="#modal" href="#">Modal Toggle</a>

<div class="modal" data-modal-window id="modal">
	<a class="close" data-modal-close href="#">x</a>
	<h3>Modal</h3>
	<p>Modal content</p>
	<button data-modal-close>Close</button>
</div>
```

Add the `.modal-medium` or `.modal-small` class to change the modal size.

```html
<div class="modal modal-small" data-modal-window id="modal">
	...
</div>
```

Adding a `[data-modal-close]` data attribute to any button or link turns it into a modal dismiss link. The `.modal-close` class adds special styling to close links (if you wanted to use an X for close, for example). Clicking anywhere outside the modal or pressing the escape key will close the modal, too.

### 3. Assign a backup URL.

Always specify a functioning link as a backup for modals.

Modals uses modern JavaScript API's that aren't supported by older browsers, including IE 10 and lower. On modern browsers, Modals will prevent the backup URL from redirecting people away from the current page.

```html
<a data-modal="#modal" href="http://backup-url.com">Modal Toggle</a>
```

*If you need to support older browsers, you can still [download the jQuery version of modals on GitHub](https://github.com/cferdinandi/modals/tree/archive-v1).*

### 4. Initialize Modals.

In the footer of your page, after the content, initialize Modals. And that's it, you're done. Nice work!

```html
<script>
	modals.init();
</script>
```



## Installing with Package Managers

You can install Modals with your favorite package manager.

* **NPM:** `npm install modals.js`
* **Bower:** `bower install https://github.com/cferdinandi/modals.git`
* **Component:** `component install install cferdinandi/modals`



## Working with the Source Files

If you would prefer, you can work with the development code in the `src` directory using the included [Gulp build system](http://gulpjs.com/). This compiles, lints, and minifies code.

### Dependencies
Make sure these are installed first.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) `sudo npm install -g gulp`

### Quick Start

1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install required files.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
	* `gulp` manually compiles files.
	* `gulp watch` automatically compiles files and applies changes using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/).



## Options and Settings

Modals includes smart defaults and works right out of the box. But if you want to customize things, it also has a robust API that provides multiple ways for you to adjust the default options and settings.

### Global Settings

You can pass options and callbacks into Modals through the `init()` function:

```javascript
modals.init({
	selectorToggle: '[data-modal]', // Modal toggle selector
	selectorWindow: '[data-modal-window]', // Modal window selector
	selectorClose: '[data-modal-close]', // Modal window close selector
	modalActiveClass: 'active', // Class applied to active modal windows
	modalBGClass: 'modal-bg', // Class applied to the modal background overlay
	preventBGScroll: false, // Boolean, prevents background content from scroll if true
	preventBGScrollHtml: true, // Boolean, adds overflow-y: hidden to <html> if true (preventBGScroll must also be true)
	preventBGScrollBody: true, // Boolean, adds overflow-y: hidden to <body> if true (preventBGScroll must also be true)
	backspaceClose: true, // Boolean, whether or not to enable backspace/delete button modal closing
	stopVideo: true, // Boolean, if true, stop videos when tab closes
	callbackOpen: function ( toggle, modal ) {}, // Functions to run after opening a modal
	callbackClose: function ( toggle, modal ) {} // Functions to run after closing a modal
});
```

***Note:*** *If you change the `selectorToggle`, you still need to include the `[data-modal]` attribute in order to pass in the selector for the navigation menu.*

*If your modal includes any form fields, you should set `backspaceClose` to `false` or users will not be able to delete their text.*

### Use Modals events in your own scripts

You can also call Modals events in your own scripts.

#### openModal()
Open a specific modal window.

```javascript
modals.openModal(
	toggle, // Node that launches the modal. ex. document.querySelector('#toggle')
	modalID, // The ID of the modal to launch. ex '#modal'
	options, // Classes and callbacks. Same options as those passed into the init() function.
	event // Optional, if a DOM event was triggered.
);
```

**Example**

```javascript
modals.openModal( null, '#modal' );
```

#### closeModal()
Close the open modal window.

```javascript
modals.closeModal(
	options // Classes and callbacks. Same options as those passed into the init() function.
);
```

**Example**

```javascript
modals.closeModal();
```

#### destroy()
Destroy the current `modals.init()`. This is called automatically during the init function to remove any existing initializations.

```javascript
modals.destroy();
```



## Brower Compatibility

Modals works in all modern browsers, and IE 10 and above. You can extend browser support back to IE 9 with the [classList.js polyfill](https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js/).

Modals is built with modern JavaScript APIs, and uses progressive enhancement. If the JavaScript file fails to load, or if your site is viewed on older and less capable browsers, all content will be displayed by default.
